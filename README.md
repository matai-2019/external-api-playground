# Choose your own API adventure

This uses (`boilerplate-react-webpack`)[https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/boilerplate-react-webpack] as a template

* Select from one of the links below (or find your own public API) and build up some React components around one or more of them.
  * http://wheretheiss.at/w/developer: get the lat/lon of the ISS
  * https://eda-te-reo.herokuapp.com: get Maori proverbs and translations
  * https://api.nasa.gov/api.html: a library of APIs from NASA
  * https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1: the Earth Observatory
  * https://market.mashape.com/explore?sort=developers: a LOT of APIs
* If a pair chooses an API that enforces CORS, they'll need to consume the API from their server-side and consume their own API. This is great practice for them.
